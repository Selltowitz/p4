# Exercices on a VM

## Description
This part of the git repo focuses on exercices which can be done in the [P4-VM](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials). Please install it on your machine or at least mininet (don't know whether Mininet is enough, haven't tried yet).


The main focus of those exercices is getting an "easier" start into the programming language and will be explained in the associated exercice folder. The code will evolve from exercice to exercice in complexity and implemented stuff (e.g. protocol headers, use of tables, more dynamic forwarding, ...).

## Connection with Bachelor Thesis (german)
A introduction to P4 is given in my [Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/Selltowitz/p4/blob/main/Aufbau_einer_Lernplattform_zur_Programmiersprache_P4.pdf) which firstly explains the most important things for getting into P4 (parser, headers, data types, actions, control blocks, tables). There are code examples in the thesis (general use with parameters and limitations + specific use).
The installation of the VM and all exercices here are explained as well.

## Relevant Documentation

The documentation for P4_16 and P4Runtime is available [here](https://p4.org/specs/)

All excercises in the VM_Exercices folder use the v1model architecture, the documentation for which is available at:
1. The BMv2 Simple Switch target document accessible [here](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/docs/simple_switch.md) talks mainly about the v1model architecture.
2. The include file `v1model.p4` has extensive comments and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/v1model.p4).

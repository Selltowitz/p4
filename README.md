# p4
This git repo focuses on [P4 (Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors)] (https://p4.org/)

It is connected to a research program https://www.ifaf-berlin.de/projekte/nettraffic-p4/ at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin (HTW Berlin) https://htw-berlin.de under Prof. Dr. Thomas Scheffler https://github.com/tscheffl and my own Bachelor thesis "Building a platform to get started with P4".

I created 6 exercices on the P4-VM (Linux) of the P4 Language Consortium using Mininet.
3 of those exercices have been successfully ported to real hardware (Edgecore Wedge 100BF-32X with Intel Tofino1). The main focus of those exercices is getting an "easier" start into the programming language and will be explained later.
